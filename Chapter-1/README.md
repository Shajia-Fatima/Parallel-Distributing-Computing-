# 1.Data Parallelism
This code generates two arrays of random floating-point numbers using NumPy, each with 1,000,000 elements. It performs element-wise addition of these arrays, leveraging NumPy's efficient internal parallelism. Finally, it measures and prints the computation time and the first 10 elements of the result.
