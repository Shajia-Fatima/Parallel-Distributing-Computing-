  # TOPICS  

# 1.Data Parallelism
This code generates two arrays of random floating-point numbers using NumPy, each with 1,000,000 elements. It performs element-wise addition of these arrays, leveraging NumPy's efficient internal parallelism. Finally, it measures and prints the computation time and the first 10 elements of the result.

# 2.Message passing programming 
This MPI-based Python code demonstrates inter-process communication using mpi4py. It requires at least two processes: process 0 sends a dictionary containing personal data to process 1, while process 1 receives and prints it. Additional processes remain idle without performing any operations.

# 3.Semaphore
This Python program uses a semaphore to synchronize access to a shared resource among multiple threads. Only one thread can access the resource at a time, ensuring thread-safe execution. It creates and starts 5 threads, each acquiring the semaphore, accessing the resource, and releasing the semaphore after a 2-second simulated task.
