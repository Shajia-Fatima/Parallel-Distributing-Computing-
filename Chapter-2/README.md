# Barrier
This code simulates a race where multiple threads (representing runners) reach a barrier before proceeding. Here's a summary:
   1. Barrier Synchronization: A `Barrier` is used to synchronize the runners. Each runner (thread) waits at the barrier until all runners have reached it.
   2. Runners: Three runners (`Huey`, `Dewey`, and `Louie`) are simulated by threads. Each thread sleeps for a random time between 2 and 5 seconds before reaching the barrier.
   3. Race Execution: The race begins, and once all runners reach the barrier, the race continues and finishes.
The use of `Barrier` ensures that all threads (runners) wait for each other before continuing.

# Condition
This code simulates the producer-consumer problem using threading and a `Condition` for synchronization. The producer thread adds items to a shared list, while the consumer thread removes them. Both threads wait when the list is full or empty, respectively, ensuring proper coordination. Actions are logged with timestamps for clarity, and `join()` ensures the main function waits for both threads to finish.

# Event
This code demonstrates the producer-consumer problem using Python's `threading.Event` for synchronization between two threads. The `Producer` thread generates random items and appends them to a shared list, signaling the `Consumer` thread each time an item is added by setting the event with `event.set()`. The `Consumer` thread waits for the event to be set and then pops an item from the list to consume it. The event ensures that the consumer only consumes items after they are produced, preventing race conditions. The actions of both threads are logged with timestamps and thread names, and `join()` ensures the program waits for both threads to finish before exiting.
